## Introduction

Freego Passport is a data-intensive application that requires continuous processing of data to provide valuable insights. This project automates the data processing tasks by leveraging Apache Airflow and various big data technologies.

The main components of the system are:
- **Apache Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform used for ingesting data from different sources.
- **Apache Storm**: A real-time stream processing system that consumes Kafka messages and triggers Spark jobs.
- **Apache Spark**: A fast and general-purpose cluster computing framework used for data processing and analytics.
- **HDFS**: A distributed file system used for storing and retrieving large volumes of data.
- **Hive**: A data warehouse infrastructure that provides querying and analysis capabilities on top of Hadoop.
- **HBase**: A NoSQL database built on top of Hadoop HDFS, providing real-time read/write access to large datasets.

## Setup

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Apache Airflow**: Refer to the official Apache Airflow documentation to install and configure Airflow for your specific environment.

2. **Install and Configure Dependencies**: Install and configure the following technologies:
   - Apache Kafka: Set up a Kafka cluster and create a topic for Freego Passport data.
   - Apache Storm: Set up a Storm cluster and ensure it can consume messages from Kafka.
   - Apache Spark: Install Spark and ensure it can process data from Storm.
   - HDFS: Set up an HDFS cluster and configure it to store the data.
   - Hive and HBase: Install and configure Hive and HBase for data querying.

3. **Project Structure**: Create the project directory structure as follows:

project/
├── dags/
│   ├── createhbase.py
│   ├── exe.py
│   ├── kafkastorm.py
│   ├── credentials.json
│   ├── hdfsread.py
│   ├── __pycache__/
│   ├── dag.py
│   ├── html_content_template.html
│   ├── subject_template.txt
│   ├── emailoperator_demo.py
│   ├── Kafka-Storm/
│   └── test1.py
└── readme.md


4. **Configure Airflow**: Set up the Airflow environment by configuring the necessary settings, such as the database connection and executor, in the Airflow configuration file.

5. **Kafka Producer**: Write a Kafka producer script (e.g., using Python) to produce messages related to Freego Passport and publish them to the Kafka topic.

6. **Storm Topology**: Create a Storm topology that includes a Kafka spout to consume messages from the Kafka topic. Implement a Storm bolt that processes the consumed messages and triggers a Spark job.

7. **Spark Job**: Develop a Spark job that is triggered by the Storm bolt. The job should load data from HDFS using Spark Streaming, perform necessary transformations, and store the processed data in Hive or HBase.

8. **Hive and HBase External Table**: Create an external table in Hive that points to the data stored in HDFS or HBase. Define the table schema and any necessary partitions or buckets. Write Hive queries to retrieve and analyze the data stored in the external table.

9. **Apache Airflow DAG**: Create an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that represents the workflow of your scheduled tasks. Define the tasks in the DAG, such as Kafka producer, Storm topology submission, and Spark job execution. Configure the scheduling parameters for the tasks, such as the interval and start time. Define the dependencies between tasks using Airflow operators, such as `BashOperator` or `PythonOperator`.

10. **Automation with Apache Airflow**: Start the Airflow scheduler and web server. Upload your DAG file to the Airflow DAGs directory. Access the Airflow web interface to monitor the status and execution of your tasks. Airflow will automatically trigger the scheduled tasks based on the defined schedule and dependencies.
